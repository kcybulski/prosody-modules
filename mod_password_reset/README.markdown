Introduction
============

This module allows users to reset their password via a simple link to a web page.

Reset links may be generated by an admin through their XMPP client using the ad-hoc
command that this module provides. Alternatively other modules may reuse this module
to generate links and e.g. send them via email to the user directly.

A link is only valid for a single reset, and expires after a duration (24 hours by default).

This module depends on Prosody's internal webserver.
