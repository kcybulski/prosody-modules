#summary Stops prosody from including starttls into available features for specified remote servers.
#labels Stage-Beta

= Details =

Let's you stop Prosody from sending <starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'> feature to choppy/buggy servers which therefore would fail to re-negotiate and use a secure stream. (e.g. [http://issues.igniterealtime.org/browse/OF-405 OpenFire 3.7.0])

= Usage =

Copy the plugin into your prosody's modules directory.

And add it between your enabled modules into the global section (modules_enabled).

Then list each host as follow:
{{{
tls_s2s_blacklist = { "host1.tld", "host2.tld", "host3.tld" }
}}}

In the unfortunate case of OpenFire... you can add the Server's ip address directly as it may not send proper rfc6121 requests.
{{{
tls_s2s_blacklist_ip = { "a.a.a.a", "b.b.b.b", "c.c.c.c" }
}}}

= Compatibility =

It's supposed to work with 0.7-0.8.x
