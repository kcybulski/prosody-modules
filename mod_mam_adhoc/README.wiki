= Introduction =

This module complements mod_mam by allowing clients to change archiving preferences through an Ad-hoc command.

= Details =

When enabled, an "Archive Settings" command should appear in the list of Ad-hoc commands available.  This allows the user to change default policy (always, never, roster) and which JIDs to always store or never store.

= Usage =

First copy the module to the prosody plugins directory.

Then add "mam_adhoc" to your modules_enabled list:
{{{
    modules_enabled = {
                    -- ...
                    "mam",
                    "mam_adhoc",
                    -- ...
		}
}}}
