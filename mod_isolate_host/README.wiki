#summary Prevent communication between hosts
#labels Stage-Beta

= Introduction =

In some environments it is desirable to isolate one or more hosts, and prevent communication with external, or even other internal domains.

Loading mod_isolate_host on a host will prevent all communication with JIDs outside of the current domain, though it is possible to configure exceptions.

*Note:* if you just want to prevent communication with external domains, this is possible without a plugin. See [http://prosody.im/doc/s2s#disabling Prosody: Disabling s2s] for more information.

= Configuration =

To isolate all hosts by default, add the module to your global modules_enabled:

{{{
    modules_enabled = {
        ...
        "isolate_host";
        ...
    }
}}}

Alternatively you can isolate a single host by putting a modules_enabled line under the VirtualHost directive:

{{{
    VirtualHost "example.com"
        modules_enabled = { "isolate_host" }
}}}

After enabling the module, you can add further options to add exceptions for the isolation:

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| isolate_except_domains || A list of domains to allow communication with. ||
|| isolate_except_users || A list of user JIDs allowed to bypass the isolation and communicate with other domains. ||

*Note:* Admins of hosts are always allowed to communicate with other domains
