#summary Web administration interface
#labels Stage-Beta
= Introduction =

This module provides a basic web administration interface.
It currently gives you access to Ad-Hoc commands on any virtual host or component that you are set as an administrator for in the Prosody config file. It also provides a live list of all S2S and C2S connections.

= Installation =

  # Copy the admin_web directory into a directory Prosody will check for plugins. (cf. [http://prosody.im/doc/installing_modules Installing modules])
  # Execute the contained get_deps.sh script from within the admin_web directory. (Requires wget, tar, and a basic shell)

= Configuration Details =

"admin_web" needs to be added to the modules_enabled table of the host you want to load this module on.

By default the interface will then be reachable under `http://example.com:5280/admin`, or `https://example.com:5281/admin`.

The module will automatically enable two other modules if they aren't already: mod_bosh (used to connect to the server from the web), and mod_admin_adhoc (which provides admin commands over XMPP).
