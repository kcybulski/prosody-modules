Introduction
============

[PKIX over Secure HTTP (POSH)][rfc7711] describes a method of
securely delegating a domain to a hosting provider, without that hosting
provider needing keys and certificates covering the hosted domain.

# Setup

This module performs POSH validation of other servers. It is *not*
needed to delegate your own domain.
