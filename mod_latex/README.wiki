#summary Replace LaTeX markup in messages with embedded images
#labels Stage-Beta

= Introduction =

This module intercepts messages between users and into chatrooms, and attaches a links to a rendered version of any [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX LaTeX] in the message. This requires client support for [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html XHTML-IM], and fetching images via HTTP.

This module was tested with the [http://gajim.org/ Gajim] client.

= Details =

There is no configuration (yet). The module uses [http://www.mathtran.org/ MathTran] to render the LaTeX.

= Todo =
  * Support for other rendering services (easy)
  * Provide a built-in rendering service (e.g. mimetex)
  * Send the images inline over XMPP (little client support at the moment)
