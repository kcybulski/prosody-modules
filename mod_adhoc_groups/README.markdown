summary: Lets users create and join roster groups
---

Introduction
============

This module lets you join groups using an ad-hoc command. When a user
joins a group, everyone in the group is added to their roster, and they
are added to the rosters of existing members.

TODO
====

-   Leaving groups
-   Add a roster group/tag when adding roster items (tricky with current
    rostermanager API)
