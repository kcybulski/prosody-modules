#summary XEP-0313: Message Archive Management for MUC
#labels Stage-Alpha

= Introduction =

This module logs the conversation of chatrooms running on the server to Prosody's archive storage.
To access them you will need a client with support for
[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html XEP-0313: Message Archive Management]
or a module such as [mod_http_muc_log].

= Usage =

First copy the module to the prosody plugins directory.

Then add "mam_muc" to your modules_enabled list:
{{{
Component "conference.example.org" "muc"
modules_enabled = {
	"mam_muc",
}
storage = {
	-- This makes mod_mam_muc use the sql2 storage backend (others will use internal)
	-- which at the time of this writing is the only one supporting stanza archives
	muc_log = "sql2";
}
}}}

See [https://prosody.im/doc/storage Prosodys data storage documentation]
for more info on how to configure storage for different plugins.

= Configuration =

Logging needs to be enabled for each room in the room configuration dialog.

{{{
	muc_log_by_default = true; -- Enable logging by default (can be disabled in room config)

	muc_log_all_rooms = false; -- set to true to force logging of all rooms

	-- This is the largest number of messages that are allowed to be retrieved in one MAM request.
	max_archive_query_results = 20;

	-- This is the largest number of messages that are allowed to be retrieved when joining a room.
	max_history_messages = 1000;
}}}
