#summary Serve Candy from prosody

= Introduction =
This is a very simple demo module showing how to serve a BOSH-using web app from prosody.

= Installation =

[http://prosody.im/doc/installing_modules Install] and [http://prosody.im/doc/modules_enabled enable] the module just like any other.  Note the included HTML file in the www_files directory, this directory needs to be in the same place as the module.

You then need to download Candy and unpack it into the www_files directory, for example with curl:

{{{
curl -L http://github.com/candy-chat/candy/tarball/master | tar xzfv - --strip-components=1
}}}

After the module has been loaded, Candy will by default be reachable from `http://example.com:5280/candy/`
