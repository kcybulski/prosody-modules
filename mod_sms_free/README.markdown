Introduction
============

This module sends an SMS to your phone when you receive a message on XMPP when
your status is xa or disconnected.

Note that it doesnâ€™t support sending SMS to anyone else than yourself, in that
it is quite different from other gateways.

Configuration
=============

In prosody.cfg.lua:

    modules_enabled = {
        "sms_free",
    }

Usage
=====

Every user who wants to use this gateway can issue an ad-hoc command to their
server, then follow the instructions and start receiving messages by SMS when
they are unavailable or xa.
