= Installation =

You must install [mod_lib_ldap] to use this module. After that, you need only copy mod_storage_ldap.lua and ldap/vcard.lib.lua to your Prosody installation's plugins directory. Make sure vcard.lib.lua is installed under plugins/ldap/.

= Configuration =

In addition to the configuration that [mod_lib_ldap] itself requires, this plugin also requires the following fields in the ldap section:

  * user.namefield
  * groups.memberfield
  * groups.namefield
  * groups.basedn
  * vcard_format (optional)

See the README.md distributed with [mod_lib_ldap] for details.
