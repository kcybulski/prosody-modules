#summary Module enabling "on-hold" functionality

= Introduction =

Enable mod_onhold to allow temporarily placing messages from particular JIDs "on hold" -- i.e. store them, but do not deliver them until the hold status is taken away.


= Details =

Right now, it is configured through adding JIDs to a list in prosody.cfg.lua. Eventually, more dynamically configurable support will be added (i.e. with ad-hoc commands or some such thing).

Simply enable mod_onhold in your list of modules, and then add a line:

onhold_jids = { "someone@address.com", "someoneelse@address2.com" }

Until those JIDs are removed, messages from those JIDs will not be delivered. Once they are removed and prosody is restarted, they will be delivered the next time the user to which they are directed logs on.
