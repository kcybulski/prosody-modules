#summary Provides a web interface to stored chatroom logs
#labels Stage-Beta

= Introduction =

This module provides a built-in web interface to view chatroom logs stored by [mod_mam_muc].

= Installation =

Just copy the folder muc_log_http as it is, into the modules folder of your Prosody installation.

= Configuration Details =

You need to add muc_log_http to your global modules_enabled, and the configuration options similarly must be put into your global (server-wide) options section:

{{{
	Component "conference.example.com" "muc"
	modules_enabled = {
		.....
		"mam_muc";
		"http_muc_log";
		.....
	}
	storage = {
		muc_log = "sql2"; -- for example
	}
}}}

The web interface would then be reachable at the address:
{{{
http://conference.example.com:5280/muc_log/
}}}

See [http://prosody.im/doc/http the page about Prosodys HTTP server] for info about the address.

= Compatibility =

Requires Prosody 0.10 or above and a storage backend with support for stanza archives.
