#summary Sync avatars between vCards and PEP
#labels Stage-Alpha

= Introduction =

This module pushes the users nickname and avatar from vCards into PEP, or into vCards from PEP.  This allows interop between older clients that use [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0153.html XEP-0153: vCard-Based Avatars] to see the avatars of clients that use [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html XEP-0084: User Avatar] and vice versa.

= Configuration =

Simply [https://prosody.im/doc/installing_modules#prosody-modules enable it like most other modules], no further configuration needed.
