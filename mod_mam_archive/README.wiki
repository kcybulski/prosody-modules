#summary XEP-0136: Message Archiving frontend for mod_mam
#labels Stage-Alpha

= Introduction =

Implementation of [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html XEP-0136: Message Archiving] for [mod_mam].


= Details =

See [mod_mam] for details.

= Usage =

First configure mod_mam as specified in it's [mod_mam wiki]. Make sure it uses sql2 storage backend.

Then add "mam_archive" to your modules_enabled list:
{{{
    modules_enabled = {
        -- ...
        "mam_archive",
        -- ...
    }
}}}

= Configuration =

Because of the fact that [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0136.html XEP-0136] defines a 'conversation' concept not present in [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html XEP-0313], we have to assume some periods of chat history as 'conversations'.

Conversation interval defaults to one day, to provide for a convenient usage.

{{{
archive_conversation_interval = 86400; -- defined in seconds. One day by default
}}}

That is the only reason SQL database is required as well.
