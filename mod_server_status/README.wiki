#summary Server status plugin
#labels Stage-Stable

= Introduction =

This module fetches the current status of configured hosts and/or stanza statistics from [http://code.google.com/p/prosody-modules/wiki/mod_stanza_counter# mod_stanza_counter].
And outputs it in either XML or JSON format.

= Usage =

Copy the file into prosody's module directory and place it into your global's enabled modules.

Configuration example:
{{{
server_status_basepath = "/server-info/"
server_status_show_hosts = { "iwanttoshowifthishostisonline.com", "iwanttoshowifthishostisonline2.com" }
server_status_show_comps = { "muc.iwanttoshowifthishostisonline.com", "transport.iwanttoshowifthishostisonline.com" }
server_status_json = true
}}}

By default the plugin's output is in XML, setting server_status_json to "true" will turn it into JSON instead.
if mod_stanza_counter isn't loaded the plugin will require at least either server_status_show_hosts or server_status_show_comps to be set.

= Info =

 * This is only compatible with 0.9 for older versions please look at the 0.8-diverge branch.
