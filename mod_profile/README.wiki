In addition to the ageing protocol defined by [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0054.html XEP-0054], it also supports the [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0292.html new vCard 4 based protocol] and integrates with [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0163.html Personal Eventing Protocol].  The vCard 4, [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html User Avatar] and [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0172.html User Nickname] PEP nodes are updated when the vCard is changed..
